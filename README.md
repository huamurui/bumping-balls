# Socket.io-Game-Demo

I made a smaller Version of the [Socket.io-Game-Demo](https://github.com/sgoedecke/socket-io-game), which is stored here [MyDemo](https://github.com/huamurui/bumping-balls/tree/socket_io-game-demo). And then, I refactored the [bouncing-balls](https://github.com/MTrajK/bouncing-balls), place it in this repo now you are reading.

There are lots of things through the process....
